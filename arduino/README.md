Code for all things Maker Faire 2015

Arduino0 gets telemetry, ultrasound and battery levels
Arduino2 controls the motors

(you need to add the libraries to your sketchbook folder!)



Dev note: Arduino1 contained the code to get orientation and IMU sensors. During testing we discovered that sometimes it made the arduino hang and thus stopped providing all telemetry so we've removed all code and made Arduino0 instead.
